# Seattle Service Offering Analysis

## Introduction

This project aims to analyze the relationship between various factors such as listing size, type, amenities, price, booking rate, and distance to downtown Seattle. The goal is to optimize service offerings for a company interested in the Seattle market.

## Libraries Used

- `pandas`: For data manipulation and analysis.
- `numpy`: For numerical operations.
- `matplotlib`: For creating static, interactive, and animated visualizations in Python.
- `seaborn`: For making statistical graphics in Python.
- `math`: For mathematical functions.

## Motivation

The motivation behind this project is to provide actionable insights into the Seattle real estate market, particularly for short-term rental properties. By understanding the factors that influence price and booking rate, a service provider can make informed decisions to maximize revenue and occupancy rates.

## Files in the Repository

- `AirBnB Analysis.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the exploratory data analysis and visualizations.
- `listings.csv`: The dataset used for the analysis, containing details about the listings.
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the project and the repository.

## Summary of Results

The analysis revealed that:
- There is a positive correlation between the size and type of a listing and its price per night.
- Certain amenities are more likely to increase the booking rate of a listing.
- The distance to downtown Seattle affects both the price and the booking rate, with a trend indicating that closer proximity may lead to higher prices and booking rates.

## Acknowledgments

Data for this analysis was provided by Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/airbnb/seattle/) with the original AirBnB data available here: http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data/ . The project was inspired by the need for comprehensive data-driven decision-making in the real estate service industry.

## How to Use
